### This is still in the development stage

# Installation/Use Instructions:
## It's expected that npm and node.js are installed and available for use.
## The following steps are essentially a walkthrough to build a React App with our custom client and server source files.

# 1) Open a terminal and navigate to a desired location to install the app

# 2) Build the skeleton client app (takes a few minutes):

### `npx create-react-app client`


# 3) Navigate to the 'client' directory and install the necessary dependencies:
### `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap react-router-dom react-icons axios nodemon`


# 4) Once complete, move outside the client directory


# 5) Then download our soruce files in this location, replacing when prompted


# 6) Navigate to the 'server' directory and install the necessary dependencies:
### `npm install cors dotenv express mongodb mongoose nodemon`


# 7) In the 'client' directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the frontend in the default browser.
Opens at [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.


# 8) In the 'server' directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the backend server.
Listening on [http://localhost:4000]
