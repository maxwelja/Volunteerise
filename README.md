# It's expected that npm and node.js are installed and available for use.
# The following steps are essentially a walkthrough to build a React App with our custom frontend and backend files.

## Installation/Use Instructions:

# 1) To build the skeleton app:
### `npm create-react-app client`


# 2) Navigate to the 'client' directory and install the necessary dependencies:
### `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap react-router-dom react-icons axios nodemon`


# 3) Once complete, move outside the client directory


# 4) Then download our soruce files in this location, replacing when prompted


# 5) Navigate to the 'server' directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   Note: nodemon is required for the use of 'npm run dev'
### `npm install cors dotenv express mongodb mongoose nodemon`


# 6) In the 'client' directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the frontend in the default browser.
Opens at [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.


# 7) In the 'server' directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the backend server.
Listening on [http://localhost:4000]
