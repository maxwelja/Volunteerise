It' expected that npm and node.js are installed and available for use.

The following steps are essentially a walkthrough to build a React App with our custom frontend and backend files.

## To build the skeleton app:
### `npm create-react-app client`

## Navigate to the 'client' directory then:
### `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap react-router-dom react-icons axios nodemon`

## Once complete, move outside the client directory
## Then download our soruce files in this location, replacing when prompted

## Available Scripts

In the 'client' directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In the 'server' directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
